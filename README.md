## About This Project

This monorepo is the official reference implementation for **The Pure Go Standard Library Stack**, a complete architecture for building secure, maintainable, and dependency-free web applications.

The primary goal is to provide a structured and scalable environment that relies exclusively on Go's standard library. The project's philosophy revolves around shipping a **single, self-contained executable binary** that can be easily deployed on any platform Go supports. This approach emphasizes performance, ultimate simplicity, and long-term stability by avoiding all external dependencies for core application logic.

<details>
<summary><h3>The Pure Go Standard Library Stack (Click to Expand)</h3></summary>

This stack represents a minimalist, robust architecture for building secure and maintainable web applications. It is composed entirely of a Go backend that leverages the standard library, removing all external dependencies for routing, validation, and data access. The stack prioritizes ultimate simplicity, zero-dependency deployment, and long-term stability by relying exclusively on Go's native capabilities. The frontend is reduced to plain HTML and CSS, with no JavaScript.

---

### **Frontend**

The frontend architecture is intentionally simplified to its core components, delivering a fast, accessible, and extremely maintainable user experience by avoiding all client-side scripting and build tools.

- [**Go `html/template`**](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template)
    - **Role:** Secure HTML Templating.
    - **Description:** Go's standard library for server-side HTML rendering. It provides automatic, context-aware escaping to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), making it a secure foundation for web interfaces.
- **Plain CSS**
    - **Role:** Styling.
    - **Description:** A standard, handwritten CSS file served as a static asset. This approach removes the need for pre-processors or build steps, maximizing simplicity and performance.

---

### **Backend**

A lean, performant, and maintainable backend service architected using only the Go standard library for maximum stability and minimal external dependencies.

- [**Go**](https://go.dev/doc/)
    - **Role:** Backend Language.
    - **Description:** A statically typed, compiled language known for performance, concurrency, and simplicity. It compiles to a single, dependency-free binary, streamlining deployment.
- [**`net/http`**](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)
    - **Role:** Web Server & Routing.
    - **Description:** The standard library's package for all HTTP-related tasks. As of Go 1.22, it includes an enhanced request router that supports method-based routing and wildcards, removing the need for third-party frameworks.
- **Custom Validation Functions**
    - **Role:** Data Validation.
    - **Description:** Data validation is handled by simple, explicit Go functions. This approach keeps validation logic clear, type-safe, and tightly integrated with the application's domain.
- [**`os`**](https://pkg.go.dev/os)
    - **Role:** Environment Variable Loading.
    - **Description:** Configuration is loaded from environment variables using the standard `os.Getenv` function, adhering to twelve-factor app principles without external libraries.

---

### **Database & Caching**

A zero-dependency, in-process data layer that maximizes simplicity and speed by using Go's native database interface and basic concurrency primitives.

- [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)
    - **Role:** Embedded Relational Database.
    - **Description:** A self-contained, serverless SQL database engine that runs in-process, eliminating operational overhead and making it ideal for a wide range of production workloads.
- [**`database/sql`**](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql)
    - **Role:** SQL Database Interface.
    - **Description:** The standard libraryâ€™s lean interface for SQL databases. It provides direct control over database operations via raw SQL queries, avoiding the overhead of an ORM.
- **SQL/Go Migration Scripts**
    - **Role:** Database Schema Migrations.
    - **Description:** Migrations are managed with numbered SQL files or simple Go programs using `database/sql`. This method avoids external tooling and keeps schema management transparent.
- [**`sync`**](https://pkg.go.dev/sync)
    - **Role:** In-Process Caching.
    - **Description:** High-performance, in-process caching is achieved with a standard Go map and a `sync.RWMutex`, providing a fast, concurrent-safe solution without external dependencies.

---

### **Testing**

A robust testing suite that relies exclusively on Go's powerful, built-in testing framework to ensure code quality and correctness.

- [**`testing`**](https://pkg.go.dev/testing)
    - **Role:** Core Testing Framework.
    - **Description:** The built-in package for unit, integration, and benchmark tests. Assertions use simple `if` statements with `t.Errorf`, keeping tests clear and dependency-free.

---

### **CLI, Development & Deployment**

A minimalist toolchain using built-in Go commands and standard, universally available tools for a smooth developer workflow.

- [**`flag`**](https://pkg.go.dev/flag)
    - **Role:** Command-Line Interface.
    - **Description:** The standard library's package for parsing command-line options. It is sufficient for building CLIs for most applications without third-party dependencies.
- [**Mage / Magefile**](https://magefile.org/)
    - **Role:** Task Runner / Build System.
    - **Description:** A build tool that uses plain Go functions as runnable, Makefile-like targets. By replacing shell scripts with Go code, a `Magefile` creates a cross-platform, easy-to-maintain build system for development tasks.
- **Simple Shell Scripts**
    - **Role:** Live Reloading.
    - **Description:** During development, a simple shell script can watch for file changes, automatically recompiling and restarting the server for a rapid feedback loop.

---

### **CI/CD**

A fully automated pipeline using standard Go tools to build, test, and deploy the application, ensuring consistency and quality.

- [**GitHub Actions**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
    - **Role:** Automated CI/CD Platform.
    - **Description:** A CI/CD workflow defined in the project repository automates the entire lifecycle. The pipeline performs:
        - **Linting & Formatting:** Runs [**`gofmt`**](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt) and [**`go vet`**](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet) to enforce code style and identify issues.
        - **Testing:** Executes the test suite with the standard `go test` command.
        - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Runs [**`govulncheck`**](https://go.dev/blog/vuln) to scan for security vulnerabilities.
        - **Build:** Compiles the application into a single binary using `go build`.
